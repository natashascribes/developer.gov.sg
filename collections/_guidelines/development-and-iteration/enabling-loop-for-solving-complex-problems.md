### Overview

The Enabling Loop is a holistic guide for solving complex problems, be it in product development, operations or business support functions. It is relevant in today’s volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity based (VUCA) world, as traditional problem-solving methods no longer suffice for creating great products and user experiences. 

As teams and organisations encounter more complex problems, an adaptive mindset and varied skillsets are both needed to be more sharply attuned to users.  This is often the case whether it is about developing a new product, rejuvenating an existing one or reimagining day-to-day operations. Being able to effectively spot opportunities and develop more creative, value-added solutions are key for every organisation seeking to stay at the top of their game.

### Objective

The Enabling Loop guide aims to help leaders, product owners and teams resist the temptation to jump straight into solution mode when confronted with a problem – It enables an effective evaluation of whether a problem is worth solving first, how complex it is, before investing further to develop a solution- or to determine if it is worth continuing to invest in enhancements.  

The conscious use of the Enabling Loop enables teams and organisations to deliver value in a timelier manner, through effective solutions that realise the right opportunities, by solving the right problems.  

### Scope

The Enabling Loop guide and canvas is applicable for creating and managing products – whether it is conceptualizing new products, maintaining or enhancing existing product, improving daily operations or business support functions - and is not confined to problems with potential digital solutions.

#### Target Audience and Adoption Criteria

The Enabling Loop is a good practice guideline that is useful to the following user groups:

- 	Leaders in organisations who govern and/or influence the suite of product offerings and the product strategies
- 	Product owners
- 	Product teams
- 	Project teams
- 	Operations staff or teams
- 	Staff in business support functions like, finance, HR, procurement, etc.

### Standards, Guidelines and Assessment Criteria 

The Enabling Loop includes a set of questions that can be easily worked through.  They are based on the appreciative inquiry approach and applying an agile mindset with a human-centred focus to deliver valuable outcomes. The questions can be applied for starting on a newly approved project, in product development or in an initiative.  It can also be useful for supporting decision-making and ensuring that the work is more purpose-driven than feature-driven.

Although the Enabling Loop is based on the classic design-thinking approach, key elements of systems thinking, inspired by the PERILL Model for leadership and team coaching, have been incorporated.  When using the guide questions to solve complex problems, there is an added benefit of helping to jumpstart the building of strong, capable teams.

The key steps of the Enabling Loop are to:

1.	Spot the Opportunity 
- 	Understand the problems that users have, how they are coping, the available data to determine the severity of the problem and whether it is worth solving
- 	Discuss the potential opportunities and the benefits to the users, teams, and organisations
- 	Understand from the stakeholders and the teams on how keen they feel about solving the problem and why

2.	Explore the Options
- 	Ideate on the possible options to solve the problem
- 	Evaluate the possible options 
- 	For the top-rated option (concept), determine the key assumptions and formulate an hypothesis to test
- 	Determine what the indicators might be to know whether to request for a change or persevere when there is user feedback
- 	Find out from the team how confident it is to solve the problem and why

3.	Put to Action
- 	Determine the fastest way to easily build and test the concept (carry out the experiment)
- 	Find out what the team’s needs – either internally within the team or externally obtained from the team - to carry out the experiment quickly and effectively  
- 	Measure the outcomes according to the indicators identified when “Exploring the Options”

4.	Improve Continuously
- 	Find out how the team feels at the end of the experiment – their morale level, what works and what addition support and/or improvements might be needed
- 	Determine which improvements to incorporate into the next cycle or if it is better to abort the experiment and revisit earlier segments (e.g. Spot the Opportunities, Explore the Options or Put to Action).

While these seem to take place (and are often visualised) in a sequential flow which is helpful for a start, it is meant to be practised in iterations – A data-based decision at each segment might sometimes mean that  previous segments need to be revisited.  Often, it may be required to re-establish the problem to solve, the opportunity to capture, or to validate assumptions that were previously overlooked.
