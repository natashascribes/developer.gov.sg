### Overview

With more services going digital, it is increasingly important for businesses and other entities such as non-profit organisations and associations to conduct online transactions (such as grant applications and filing of corporate taxes) with Government agencies in a safe and reliable manner. As the corporate arm of Singapore’s [National Digital Identity (NDI)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/digital-identity/national-digital-identity.html){:target="\_blank"}, Corppass was developed to be the single G2B platform for business and other entities to conduct online transactions with government agencies. 

### What is Corppass?

Corppass is a corporate digital identity for entities to conduct online transactions with agencies. Local entities with Unique Entity Number (UEN) and foreign entities are both eligible for Corppass.

### Why Should Corppass be Adopted?

The benefits of Corppass include:

- Enables access to more than 250 government digital services from agencies such as Enterprise Singapore, Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), and Singapore Customs For details on the available digital services, click [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/help/CP_Digital_Service_List_and_Other_Info.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.
- Brings convenience by providing a single platform for corporate entities to conduct online transactions with agencies.
- Provides flexibility by allowing entities to grant their employees separate roles when transacting with agencies.

### How Do You Use Corppass?

**For local entities with UEN**

1. The entity’s Registered Officer (RO) (person officially registered with the relevant UEN-issuance agency) first needs to nominate someone to be the Corppass Admin (person who shall manage the entity’s Corppass). Note that ROs may nominate themselves as Corpass Admin.
2. The chosen Corppass Admin can now register for a Corppass account [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/cpauth/login/homepage?URL=%2F&TAM_OP=login){:target="\_blank"}. (Click on the "Services" tab, then select "Register for Corppass".)

When the RO and the Corppass Admin are the same person, the following information are required for registration:
-	Entity’s Unique Entity Number (UEN)
-	Your Singpass login details (ID and Password)
-	Your email address

When the RO and the Corppass Admin are different people, the following additional information are required for registration:
-	Last 5 characters of Registered Officer’s NRIC
-	Registered Officer’s email address

**For Foreign entities**

1. The entity first needs to nominate someone to be the Corppass Admin. 
2. The chosen Corppass Admin can now register for a Corppass account [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/cpauth/login/homepage?URL=%2F&TAM_OP=login){:target="\_blank"}. (Click on the "Services" tab, then select "Register for Corppass".)

Foreign entities can register for a Corppass account via either Singpass or Foreign ID.
