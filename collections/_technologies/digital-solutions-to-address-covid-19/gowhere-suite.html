<h2>Why Should GoWhere Suite be Adopted?</h2>

<p>
  GoWhere Suite is a one-stop resource hub for all official COVID-19 related information. By consolidating COVID-19 related resources in one website, Singapore residents can efficiently and quickly obtain accurate information. Besides English, GoWhere Suite can also be adapted to Chinese, Malay or Tamil this increases its mass appeal as residents who are more proficient in their Mother Tongue can utilise the website too. The various search functions present also prevents users from scrolling through multiple sites, tabs and portals. Misleading or false information can also be cross-checked against the information present on GoWhere Suite or through the contact points present on the various sites.
</p>
