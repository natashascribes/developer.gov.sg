  SupplyAlly - Distribution Made Simple
</h2>
<p>
  Developed by GovTech, SupplyAlly is a mobile app that facilitates
  the process of logistics distribution during COVID-19.
</p>
<p>
  During this period, distributing supplies to the entire population meant that
  the coordination of manpower had to take place on a nation-wide scale,
  with each item—and its recipient—accounted for. When the urgent need arose for
  reusable face masks to be distributed to residents across Singapore,
  GovTech’s Government Digital Services team was able to develop SupplyAlly,
  a mobile app that facilitates these processes, within a short span of four days.
  The app serves as a single solution for both the management of a flexible pool
  of supply-distributing volunteers, as well as the tracking of collection quotas.

<h3>How does SupplyAlly work?</h3>

<p>
  <b>Seamless registration</b> - SupplyAlly removes the hassle of
  requiring volunteers to sign up with personal details. Instead,
  volunteers are issued a QR code to be scanned using the app on their own device,
  after which they are authorised to use the app with no further details required.
  The QR codes are then permanently affiliated with the user’s device,
  meaning that they cannot be used for unauthorised logins even if someone else obtains them.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Secure transaction of supplies</b> - Using the app, volunteers can scan
  the identity cards of residents to verify their eligibility and log the
  successful distribution of the item. No personally identifiable information
  is ever stored, only a time-stamped digital signature that prevents
  the same barcode from being used for a duplicate collection.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Supports various redemption methods</b> - SupplyAlly allows for the
  redemption of items not just by selected individuals, but also by
  selected households. This means that an individual can collect items on behalf
  of their household if they are eligible. Items distributed to beneficiaries
  are also trackable.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Multipurpose utility</b> - SupplyAlly can be used for a variety of distribution purposes.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Support for various environments</b> - The app serves as a
      one-stop solution that connects to multiple environments for
      different policies and distribution initiatives. The same application
      can support all of these at the same time, cutting out logistical issues
      and freeing up volunteers to focus on distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Development agility</b> - This widespread applicability is bolstered by
      the app’s development agility—thanks to over-the-air updates and
      Continuous Integration (CI) setups, the team can push fully developed
      features from the development environment to users’ devices within half an hour.
      This drastically cuts turnaround time and allows the app to keep pace with
      any new initiatives being rolled out.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Built to handle volume</b> - The app’s lightweight build and
  minimal integrations allows it to process transactions with great speed -
  up to 4,500 transactions per second, with a 50-millisecond response latency.

  Since its launch on 5 April 2020, SupplyAlly has facilitated the management of
  hundreds of volunteers and the distribution of 4.2 million reusable masks.
  It has also been used in partnership with the non-profit Engineering Good to
  provide refurbished laptops to under-privileged children for home-based
  learning programmes. Over $20 million in physical credit vouchers for
  low-income households have also been delivered through the app.
</p>
<p>
  SupplyAlly is also being used to distribute

    TraceTogether Tokens
  </a> and will continue to be used in partnership with charities for the allocation of
  food packs and meal credit redemptions.
