<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Nectar is a platform-as-a-service hosting solution developed by GovTech's
  <a href="//https://blog.gds-gov.tech/">Government Digital Services</a> team.
  It allows engineers to build and deploy applications directly from source code
  in their git repositories, bringing speed, reliability and simplicity to the
  building and deployment of digital services. Nectar was also designed to meet
  the standards and security requirements mandated by the Government.
</p>
<h3>How Nectar works</h3>
<p>
  The Nectar platform was designed to integrate the complete delivery pipeline
  involving pulling of source code, performing builds, running security scans,
  deploying the application, on-demand scaling and monitoring.
</p>
<h4>Containerised Application Delivery</h4>
<p>
  Docker container packaging provided a clean, lightweight yet powerful way of
  delivering application packages to the platform. The container packages
  contain everything the application requires to run.
</p>
<p>
  For orchestration of containers, Nectar uses OpenShift which is based on
  Kubernetes and commercially supported by Red Hat.
</p>
<h4>Self-Service Provisioning and Deployment</h4>
<p>
  The Nectar portal provides a simple user interface for building and deploying
  containerised applications. Self-service capabilities reduce operational needs
  and manual errors. It also improved turn-around times for setting up new
  deployments significantly for the Government.
</p>
<p>
  Once logged in, users can provision new services dynamically and allocate
  compute resources to their services as required.
</p>
<h4>Built-In Security Scanning Tools</h4>
<p>
  Securing apps in the modern internet era is a challenging feat. A huge number
  of vulnerabilities are discovered regularly and it is challenging for all
  government applications to adhere to regular scanning and patching, as it is
  largely a reactive process and done manually. While such methods work to some
  extent, the cost is huge and the process is error prone. With built-in
  security scanning tools, the process becomes continuous and seamless.

<h3>Why government agencies should adopt Nectar</h3>
<p>
  There are significant benefits in having a central platform for the hosting of
  applications for government agencies.
</p>
<h4>Speed to Market</h4>
<p>
  Users can deliver and deploy apps much faster. They don’t have to waste
  valuable time in setting up the base infrastructure and the delivery pipeline.
</p>
<h4>Cost Reduction</h4>
<p>
  Users benefit from a substantial reduction in cost of developing and
  maintaining apps with the Nectar platform. There is significant reduction in
  duplicate work across all government agencies.
</p>
<h4>Easier Compliance</h4>
<p>
  Compliance is made much easier with the users having to only worry about the
  application security and audits. They don’t have to duplicate the efforts in
  auditing and complying to policies for the infrastructure.
</p>
<h4>Dynamic Scalability</h4>
<p>
  With the use of containers and 12 factor app design, the applications can be
  scaled up or down dynamically in a matter of seconds. This optimises the
  resource utilisation and gives flexibility to the users.
</p>
<h4>Continuous Delivery</h4>
<p>
  With a built-in delivery pipeline, users are able to push bug-fixes and new
  features quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Other benefits include reduced maintenance efforts, portability through open
  standards and better application security.
