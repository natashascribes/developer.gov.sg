### Overview

With fewer in-person social activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, seniors living alone are at higher risk of serious incidents such as falls. Believing that enlisting help from the members of public is the optimal and most practical way to handle urgent cases involving seniors, GovTech developed ResponderSG that aims to build a resilient community with accessible help for seniors and others at risk by enlisting help from volunteers in the community. 

ResponderSG was developed over a span of 5 months. In the early research phase, a kick-off workshop was conducted with stakeholders to ideate and come up with the app features. After estimating the effort required to develop the app the product team decided to adopt agile methodology to work together with the stakeholders, conducting meetings with them every two weeks. After further security scanning and user acceptance testing, the pilot took place over 7 months – between October 2019 and May 2020 – involving 33 volunteers including a few GovTechies.

### What is ResponderSG?

ResponderSG is a mobile app for the public that alerts nearby responders equipped with life-saving skills for urgent cases such as cardiac arrest and falls. As part of [Government Assisted Living Ecosystem (GALE)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/government-assisted-living-ecosystem){:target="_blank"}, an ecosystem built to support the assisted living infrastructure in Singapore, ResponderSG leverages the existing ecosystem to provide an end-to-end solution for skilled responders to attend to them.
