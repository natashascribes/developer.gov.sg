description: ResponderSG is a mobile app that alerts members of the public to nearby calls for assistance from seniors living alone.

### Overview

With fewer in-person social activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, seniors living alone are at higher risk of serious incidents such as falls. Believing that enlisting help from the members of public is the optimal and most practical way to handle urgent cases involving seniors, GovTech developed ResponderSG that aims to build a resilient community with accessible help for seniors and others at risk by enlisting help from volunteers in the community.
