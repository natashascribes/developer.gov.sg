  The Networked Trade Platform (NTP) is a national trade information management
  platform that provides the foundation for Singapore to be the world's leading
  trade, supply chain and trade financing hub. At its core, it represents a
  concerted effort to drive an industry-wide digital transformation to build a
  trade and logistics IT ecosystem which connects businesses, community systems
  and platforms and government systems.

  Its vision is to be a national trade info-ecosystem that provides the

    One-stop trade information management system linked to other platforms
  </li>
  <li>
    Next-generation platform offering a wide range of trade-related services
  </li>
  <li>
    Open innovation platform allowing development of insights & new services
    with cross-industry data
  </li>
  <li>
    Document hub for digitisation at source that enables reuse of data to cut
    costs and streamline processes
