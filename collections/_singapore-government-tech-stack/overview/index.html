<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  GovTech is developing the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) with a vision to modernise development practice across Whole-Of-Government (WOG) to help build secure systems that are responsive to constantly evolving citizens and business needs. To achieve this, we need to adopt a three-pront approach: <strong>People</strong>, <strong>Platform</strong> and <strong>Practice</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>People: We build the right capabilities and a growth mindset to adopt the technology practices in our development teams.</li>
  <li>Platform: We offer the right set of tools through SGTS for building high quality, secure systems.</li>
  <li>Practice: We offer guidance on how to use the tools to empower the developers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>SGTS Guiding Principles</h4>
<p>Products within SGTS are built with the following 6 principles:</p>

<h4>Key Objectives</h4>
<p>SGTS aims to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>improve agility</strong> of app development and deployment by reducing the need for agencies to set up extensive digital infrastructure. It offers a more powerful development ecosystem with right tools that allows the Government and vendors build code efficiently.</li>
  <li><strong>improve quality and compliance</strong> to policy and cyber security standards by baking them into the development environment and finding vulnerabilities early.</li>
  <li><strong>lower the costs of development</strong> of digital services by using centrally managed common services offering economies of scale and reducing duplication.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What is SGTS?</h3>
<p>
  SGTS is a set of platform tools that streamlines and simplifies the development process and enables code reuse across WOG to build secure, high quality applications.  SGTS has a 2-layer architecture where the **Base Layer** focuses on standardising development tools and environment and at the top, the **Services Layer** drives code reusability within WOG.

<h3>Why Should SGTS be Adopted?</h3>
<p>SGTS aims to improve the quality, speed, and agility of software development. The following illustration of how SGTS impacts different phases of development:</p>

<h3>Success Stories</h3>
<p>
  More than 200 systems from 40 have already reaped the benefits of SGTS by implementing their services or applications on cloud. These include time and cost savings allowing them to focus on the services and applications instead of building cloud architectures.
