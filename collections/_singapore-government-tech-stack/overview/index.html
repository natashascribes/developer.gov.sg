<h2>Introducing Singapore Government Tech Stack</h2>
<p>
  To enable government agencies to build digital services quickly and
  effectively, GovTech is developing the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS),
  a common platform that streamlines and simplifies the development process.
  With SGTS, agencies will be able to utilise a suite of tools and services
  hosted on a common infrastructure to ensure consistency and high quality in
  their applications.

    <p>
      A tech stack may refer to different sets of applications, depending on the
      context. Hence, as part of our next steps in adopting cloud for
      Whole-Of-Government (WOG), we intend to standardise the definition of SGTS
      - a common Base Layer consisting of components such as Toolchain,
      Communications, Runtime, Monitoring & Service Management with a clear
      product roadmap and adoption support plan. GovTech has assembled a new
      CODEX (Core Operations Development Environment and eXchange) team to do
      so.
    </p>
    <h3>Why SGTS?</h3>
    <p>
      The core focus of SGTS is to supercharge developers with agile development
      and modernise the development practice with reusable components. Today,
      <a

        >GCC</a
      >
      reduces repetition of acquiring and configuring servers, which minimises
      set-up errors and costs. With SGTS, agencies will have access to reusable
      components for application development, such as Runtime (e.g. deployment
      types like containers and serverless) and Orchestration & Management
      (e.g., CI/CD, API Gateway and Service Proxy). This will then allow
      agencies to <strong>build less and deliver more.</strong>

        <h4>Getting to know CODEX</h4>
        <p>
          CODEX is a Strategic National Project for achieving Singapore’s Smart
          Nation vision by increasing engineering productivity. The team aims to
          drive the use of GCC

          and SGTS products in WOG development, while adhering to security audit
          and compliance. The government expects to reduce operating costs
          overall with using highly reusable software components in a
          collaborative environment.

<h3>SGTS Product Roadmap</h3>
<p>
  SGTS comprises a two-layer architecture — Base Layer and Services Layer — with
  components that make up the app development lifecycle, from set-up to going
  live.
</p>

<h5>Base Layer</h5>
<img src="/assets/img/SGTSBaseLayer1.png" style="border: 2px solid #f5f5f5" />

<h5>Services Layer</h5>
<p>
  The services layer comprises rapidly evolving and widely applicable, reusable
  service components in areas including App services, Data & Analytics,
  Identity, AI and data exchange.
</p>
<h3>Reaping Benefits with SGTS</h3>
<p>
  20 agencies, 900 users across 80 systems have already reaped the benefits of
  SGTS by implementing their services or applications on cloud. These include
  time and cost savings allowing them to focus on the services and applications
  instead of building cloud architectures.
