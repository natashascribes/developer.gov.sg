## Cloud File Transfer

### Powering secure, efficient, robust file transfers

Cloud File Transfer (CFT) is a centralized, fully managed, API-driven service that allows agencies or businesses to **transfer files easily, securely and efficiently at scale**, whether you are transferring files across internet and intranet zones or within the same internet or intranet zones. CFT is a Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) Product and currently in private beta version.


### APEX vs CFT

Today, the [IM8](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/im8) policy requires applications to be separated into internet and intranet zones. Transferringâ€¯information across zones requires a bridging system. [API Exchange (APEX)](/technologies/data-and-apis/apex) was built to allow information sharing across zones. However, APEX is typically used for API requests - to share small payloads, usually as text.

To transfer large files such as PDFs, images or textual files, an agency would need to set up additional servers to act as file repositories in addition to the cross zones bridging capability. Implementing and maintaining such an infrastructure and constantly ensuring its compliance with IM8 policies/audits requires the agency to fork out additional time, money and manpower.



### How CFT Works

The following illustration shows how files are transfered in CFT:
