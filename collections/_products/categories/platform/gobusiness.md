The Government provides many services and information for businesses, which spans multiple agencies and platforms. To help businesses easily locate relevant resources in a simple and fast way, GoBusiness was developed as a central portal to provide businesses with integrated, seamless, and personalised access to relevant information, services, and resources across all stages of the business journey.

Developed by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), Ministry of Trade & Industry (MTI) and Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), GoBusiness represents the Government’s commitment to provide easy-to use, seamless, and relevant services for businesses, and to create a more pro-enterprise environment for businesses in Singapore.

-	**Access and apply for more than 200 licences across sectors**: Businesses can access and apply for new licences administered by various Government agencies via the dashboard without having to visit separate portals for different licences. In the same space, businesses can amend, renew, or cancel existing licences. 

-	**Keep track of their applications**: Businesses are kept up-to-date on their licence application status via the dashboard, and will be prompted if any action is required. 

-	**Receive personalised recommendations**: Businesses can receive a range of tailored recommendations via the dashboard. The Government Assistance e-Adviser considers a business’ unique profile when providing suggestions for relevant grants. 

These features will be introduced progressively from early 2022.
