OurSG (OSG) Grants is a one-stop, integrated portal that consolidates government grants for the arts, community, heritage, social good, sports, and youth into a single platform.

By consolidating and digitalising grant applications and administration, the portal allows government agencies to expedite grant processing and disbursement and enhance the customer experience.

OSG currently hosts over 34 grants from 13 government agencies. In the future, more grants will be onboarded to continue to establish OSG as a Whole-of-Government (WOG) platform for community and social grants.

Government agencies such as the Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth have commented that the “OSG portal has allowed us to fully digitise our process, making grant monitoring and record-keeping more efficient and effective."

### Key Features
