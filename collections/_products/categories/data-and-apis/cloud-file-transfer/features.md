**Compliant with the Singapore governmentâ€™s AIAS and ICT&SS Management policy**

- CFT automatically scans incoming files for malware and removes malicious content.

**Large file exchanges with industry partners**

- CFT enables public officers to exchange up to 1GB of Restricted and Sensitive-Normal files with external parties across different applications and systems securely.

**File encryption**

- This ensures that data from agencies are safe and tamper-proof.

**Audit and monitor functions**

- Centralised controls and a simple user-interface offer end-to-end visibility on file transfers.

**Configurable security policies and workflows**

- Agencies can customize security policies and automated workflows according to their requirements.

**Event-driven notifications**

- Agencies can register their webhooks to enable real-time notifications during file transfers.

**Scheduling of file transfers**

- For example, uploading files to a common file repository at regular intervals.

**Time and cost savings**

- CFT can be set up quickly. Agencies are able to transfer files fast, without incurring the operational costs and overheads of setting up a similar service. They can scale as required based on their transfer needs.

CFT is currently in closed beta and the expected general availability (GA) date is approximately in Q1 2021. For pilot users, please note that CFT version 1.1 will be updated to CFT version 2.1 from May 2022. A comparison of the features between both versions are listed below:
