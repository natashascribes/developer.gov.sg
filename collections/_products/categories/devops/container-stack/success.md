### Success Stories

The MOE Digital Office leveraged CStack to launch a campaign microsite for Teacherâ€™s Day 2021. The microsite was custom developed using a containerised Wordpress engine that is deployed using CStack.

CStack provided the development team a compliant platform which allowed them to reduce the scope of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT).  The reduced scope then allowed them to complete the VAPT exercise within 1.5 months, despite the small team consisting of only three members.
