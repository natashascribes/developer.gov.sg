### Why Should CStack be Adopted?

The benefits of CStack include:

- **Leverage** CStack product team’s collective expertise to manage Kubernetes for you so that your team can focus on building great products.
- **Kickstart** your DevSecOps practices and agile development from day one rather than spending time setting up tools for development yourself.
- **Elevate** developer experience and performance: CStack fills the gap between operations and developers by enabling developers to manage infrastructure through code. CStack also allows agencies to deploy fast and learn from feedback with each release.
- **Stay** secure and compliant with every release: CStack’s infrastructure-as-code and policies-as-code mechanisms offer agencies the ability to enable automated auditing, thereby ensuring that your applications or services stay secure and compliant with every release.
