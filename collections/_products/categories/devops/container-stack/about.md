### What is CStack?

CStack is a cloud-based container development and hosting platform ([IM8 compliant](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/im8){:target="_blank"}) that:

- Leverages features of Kubernetes to automate deployment, and manage & scale containerised applications.
- Integrates with [SHIP-HATS](/products/categories/devops/ship-hats){:target="_blank"} to enable Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CICD) and automated application testing.
- Automates application deployment where Git is the single source of truth.
- Provisions and integrates cloud managed services such as object storage and relational databases using a declarative approach.
- Provides dashboards for developers to monitor their system metrics.
- Secures your workloads by providing an integrated set of container security tools.
