<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  By tapping on engineering capabilities to build on its existing digital infrastructure, GovTech has been able to swiftly roll out a wide variety of 
  digital tools to aid and complement our nation’s strategic response to the pandemic. In designing these tools, developers were guided by three 
  important underlying principles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compliance to public health policies and standards: Technologies had to be based on <b>sound public health principles</b> and <b>informed 
    by the needs of health authorities</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Compliance to public health standards:</b> Technologies had to be based on sound public health principles and informed by the needs of 
    health authorities.</li>
  <li><b>Accountability to the public:</b> Transparency of data collection and usage had to be ensured.</li>
  <li><b>Accessibility to all:</b> These solutions had to be accessible even to non-digital natives, with alternatives provided for the digitally 
    excluded and underserved populations where necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Timely and targeted solutions adhering to these design philosophies have been created for each unique need that has arisen due to the pandemic. Here are some of 
  the tools that we have developed to meet these needs.

            learning, it augments existing thermal scanners to improve the rate
            of contactless scanning, ease bottlenecks in long queues outside
            buildings and reduce the manpower required for temperature screening
            measures.
