<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  The COVID-19 pandemic produced an urgent need to address logistical challenges on a national scale. For example, the distribution of reusable face masks to all Singapore residents created a logistical challenge to track collection quotas and to manage a flexible pool of volunteers.
</p>
<p>
  In response to these urgent logistical challenges, GovTech’s Government Digital Services (GDS) team developed SupplyAlly, a mobile app to facilitate nationwide logistics distributions.
</p>

<h2>What is SupplyAlly?</h2>

<p>
  SupplyAlly is a mobile app that facilitates logistics distribution. Its key features include:
</p>

<b>Seamless registration</b>: SupplyAlly does not require volunteers to sign up with personal details. Instead, volunteers are issued a QR code to be scanned using the app on their device. After which, they are authorised to use the app with no further details required. The QR codes are permanently affiliated with the user’s device, meaning that they cannot be used for unauthorised logins even if someone else obtains them.

<br><br><b>Secure transaction of supplies</b>: Volunteers can scan the identity cards of residents to verify their eligibility and log the transaction. No personally identifiable information is stored, only a time-stamped digital signature that prevents the same barcode from being used for a duplicate collection.

<br><br><b>Supports various redemption methods</b>: Eligible individuals can collect items on behalf of their household as well. Items distributed to beneficiaries are also trackable.

<br><br><b>Multipurpose utility</b>: SupplyAlly can be used for a variety of distribution purposes:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Support for various environments</strong>: As a one-stop solution that connects to multiple environments for different policies and distribution initiatives, SupplyAlly eliminates logistical issues.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Development agility</strong>: With over-the-air updates and Continuous Integration (CI) setups, the team can push fully developed features to users within 30 minutes. This drastically cuts turnaround time.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Built to handle volume</b>: The app’s lightweight build and minimal integrations allows it to process transactions with great speed - up to 4,500 transactions per second, with a 50-millisecond response latency. This is necessary to keep up with the needs of an evolving 21st century pandemic such as COVID-19.

<h2>Why Should SupplyAlly be Adopted?</h2>

<p>
  Automating logistic distributions prevents wastage of resources that can occur because of a lapse in the distribution system. This prevents duplicated distributions and optimises volunteers’ efforts. SupplyAlly provides convenience to citizens while maintaining operational flexibility to different points and modes of distribution.
</p>

<h2>How Do You Use SupplyAlly?</h2>

<p>
  For volunteers:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Login to the SupplyAlly mobile app with your QR code, mobile number, and One-Time Passcode (OTP).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Proceed to the physical collection point and present your identification card for collection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Verify eligibility by scanning your identity card in SupplyAlly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      SupplyAlly checks backend on eligibility and/or any prior collection information. If the eligibility check fails, an error screen will display the reason for failure.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If eligible, you can then enter the item into SupplyAlly and hand the item to the recipient.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      SupplyAlly’s database of entitlement is updated automatically. 
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

</figure>
      
 <p>
   Since its launch on 5 April 2020, SupplyAlly has onboarded more than 8,000 users onto the SupplyAlly app, and facilitated the distribution of 4.2 million reusable masks. It has also been used in partnership with <a href="https://engineeringgood.org/" target="_blank">Engineering Good</a>, a non-profit organisation, to provide refurbished laptops to under-privileged children for home-based learning programmes. Over $20 million in physical credit vouchers for low-income households have also been delivered through the app. SupplyAlly will continue to be used in partnership with charities for the allocation of food packs and meal credit redemptions.
</p>
<p>
  SupplyAlly is also being used to distribute <a href="/products/categories/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/tracetogether" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> Tokens during the COVID-19 pandemic. To prevent further COVID-19 transmission, SupplyAlly partnered with the Ministry of Health (MOH) to distribute free DIY Covid-19 test kits to the Bukit Merah and Redhill residents in June 2021. This was subsequently rolled out to the residents in other areas and when the free test kits distribution ended in August 2021, more than 106,000 free test kits were given out to the residents. SupplyAlly will continue to be used in partnership with charities for the allocation of food packs and meal credit redemptions.
</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>
  SupplyAlly is currently deployed at <a href="https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg/" target="_blank">Food from the Heart</a>’s <a href="https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg/highlights/digitalising-food-pack-collection-qr-code-beneficiary-cards-mobile-app-88" target="_blank">community food pack</a>  programme, where volunteers use the app to enable efficient distribution of 9,000 food packs to needy households every month.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Community Development Council (CDC)</a> has digitalised their <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/up-to-400000-lower-income-households-to-receive-vouchers-to-spend-on-local-businesses" target="_blank">distribution of CDC vouchers</a>  with SupplyAlly as well.
</p>
<p>
  GovTech will continue to work with SupplyAlly partners to make improvements where necessary.
