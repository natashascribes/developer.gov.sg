<h2>Overview</h2>

</p>
<p>
  SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs identifying details of individuals (identification details and mobile numbers) visiting public venues such as malls and workplaces, as well as communal activity areas.

<h2>What is SafeEntry?</h2>

<p>
SafeEntry was built to resolve the need for an effective and practical visitor management amidst COVID-19. By logging identifying details of visitors digitally, this reduces the time needed to identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and clusters.

<p>
  To ensure that checking in and out is quick, convenient, and accessible for all, there are several check-in methods available:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Scan venue QR code with TraceTogether app</strong> – SafeEntry has been integrated with the TraceTogether app. SafeEntry QR codes can be scanned through the TraceTogether app.
    </p>
  </li>

    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <strong>Health Risk Warning (HRW)</strong><br>
  SafeEntry and TraceTogether records are used to identity close contacts of COVID positive cases. These close contacts may then receive a HRW via SMS. For more information on HRW, click <a href="https:/www.covid.gov.sg/exposed/hrw" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Why Should SafeEntry be Adopted?</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Citizens</strong> – scanning your entry and exit helps to make contact tracing more accurate and prevent COVID-19 clusters from forming.
