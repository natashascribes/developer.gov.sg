description: Form builder for government officials to build secure digital forms in minutes.
---

**What it is**

- [Form](https://www.form.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} builder for government officials to build secure digital forms in minutes. Easy to use like Google Forms, but uses end-to-end encryption so that only officials creating the form can access the data.

**Why it’s useful**

- Allows officials to set up digital services super quickly. Thousands of services were deployed in days to aid the fight against COVID-19, such as temperature taking forms, visitor declarations, contact tracing interviews, traveller approvals, assistance for returning Singaporeans and more. These services have collected data from more than a million people.

**How you can help**

- Feature development such as forms with verified phone numbers, webhook integration, geolocation field, etc

- Frontend framework refactoring and cleanup (Angular1 specifically).

- Security reviewing our codebase as we’re working towards open-sourcing this.
