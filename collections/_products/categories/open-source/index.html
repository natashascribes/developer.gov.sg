<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>

  All developers are able to access and tap on the wide range of open-source technologies by Government agencies.
  This includes a variety of products from a plethora of areas like digital identity, design and User Identity (UI), and
  infrastructure-as-code.

  You can also look at the open-source technologies that Singapore has used in its fight against COVID-19 such as
  <a href="/products/categories/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/tracetogether" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and
  <a href="/products/categories/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/vigilantgantry" target="_blank">VigilantGantry</a>.

</p>

<p>
  We have also open-sourced some of the digital tools that we are using in our
  fight against COVID-19.

      <h4>Form</h4>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.form.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Form</a>
        builder and manager used by the Singapore government and public
        healthcare institutions to securely collect data from residents and
        businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Form has been used for various data collection especially during
        COVID-19 to minimise human contact and possible transmissions. Some of
        them include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Collecting travel and health declarations by visitors to the country.
        </li>
        <li>
          Swab tests applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          COVID-19 financial assistance applications and distributions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Daily temperature declarations by citizens.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mandatory primary school registration for seven year olds nationwide.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using Form grants legitimacy to government agencies collecting
        sensitive data, making it difficult for malicious actors to steal
        citizens' data. It also provides rich features that especially support
        public sector needs - such as table-input fields, one time password (OTP) verification,
        contact details, email domain restrictions, logic to disable
        submissions and date validations.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Go.gov.sg</a>
        has been used for shortening links to various platforms.

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/whatsapp/" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/whatsapp</a>
            is an application form of the official WhatsApp broadcast of the

            <a href="https://go.gov.sg/passport/" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/passport</a>
            is an application of passport for Singaporean citizens.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Besides that, Go is also used in training materials for COVID-19
            healthcare volunteers, press releases about COVID-19, articles and
            documents.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It saves government agencies time when it comes to shortening a domain name. It also lets citizens know that
        they
        are accessing information from a legitimate government source by ensuring consistency in domain names generated.
