---

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  The GoWhere Suite is a ground-up initiative by GovTech’s Government Digital Services (GDS) team. It was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and addresses the need for a rapid and reliable source of information. It also supports location/eligibility-based information queries/discoveries, functions as an inclusive mass media channel and provides OpsTech integration to support Government distribution operations. Currently, GoWhere Suite exists as a mini-stack, featuring various government portals and has been used in 14 Government initiatives which boasts 25.4 million website visits.
</p>

<h2>Why Should the GoWhere Suite be Adopted?</h2>

<p>
  The COVID-19 pandemic was (and continues to be) volatile and rapidly evolving. This meant that the guidelines and measures in response to the pandemic were also constantly being updated. Furthermore, the extensive impact of COVID-19 necessitated response measures that cuts across many Government agencies. As a result, individuals and businesses found it difficult to keep up with the latest information and it was taxing for them to gather information from multiple agencies. As a one-stop resource hub for all COVID-19 related information, GoWhere Directory facilitates citizens and businesses to access rapid and reliable information during the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
  The pandemic also necessitated unprecedented nationwide distribution efforts. GoWhere’s suite of websites, such as ARTGoWhere and TokenGoWhere, facilitates these nationwide distribution efforts using location-based information queries/discoveries.
</p>

<h2>Success Stories</h2>

<p>
  SupportGoWhere
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
         <p>SupportGoWhere is a platform for citizens to seek assistance for various needs. It also has an eligibility checker to aid in determining qualification for the various schemes. SupportGoWhere was used to launch COVID-19 support grants such as the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG), COVID-19 Recovery Grant - Temporary (Aug 21) (CRG-T) and the Courage Fund (TCF). The site has experienced 3.5 million visits and 1.9 million unique visitors since Apr 2020.</p>

</ul>

<p>
  PassGoWhere and IdentityGoWhere
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
         <p>PassGoWhere allows workers to apply for a dormitory exit pass to head out. Information from PassGoWhere is sent to SafeEntry and SG WorkPass for enforcement purposes.

It uses the residents’ NRIC/FIN along with one or two more identifiable fields such as date of issue and date of birth for validation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  MaskGoWhere and PosterGoWhere
</p>
<ul>

         <p>Three rounds of mask distribution exercises were successfully implemented, with 5.5 million visits to MaskGoWhere which has experienced 3 million unique visitors since Feb 2020. Information on mask collection exercises were also distributed quickly and securely through MaskGoWhere.</p>
       </li>
     </ul>
<ul>
       <li>
         <p>PosterGoWhere facilitated these exercises as it allowed for standardised multilingual posters with the most up-to-date information on the distribution exercises to be created efficiently, while updating MaskGoWhere with the same information at the same time.</p>
       </li>
     </ul>

<h2> What's Next?</h2>
  <p>Beyond the Covid-19 pandemic, GoWhere suite intends to continue providing up-to-date official information to Singapore residents. The application stack of GoWhere Suite is relevant to any generic distribution operations or a location/eligibility-based query information system.</p>
<p>Government agencies and organisations such as the <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/">Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)</a>, <a href="https://www.ncss.gov.sg/">National Council of Social Service (NCSS)</a>, <a href="https://www.sgenable.sg/Pages/Home.aspx">SG Enable (SGE)</a>, and <a href="https://www.aic.sg/">Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)</a> are exploring the expansion of <a href="https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/">SupportGoWhere</a> as a one-stop social assistance portal. This could transform the delivery of social services.</p>
